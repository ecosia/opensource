## Ethical considerations

Most software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the
consequences for our society and planet.

As software developers we also recognise that our infrastructure has great power to shape the
world and the lives of those we share it with, and we choose to consciously take responsibility
for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.

We build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that
vision further from reach.

We realise it is difficult to takle this problem adding an Ethical clause to our Copyright license.

Therefore as mantainers we take the right to exclude and do not welcome changes or contributions
from individuals or organizations that:

1. lobbies for, promotes, or derives a majority of income from actions that support or contribute to:
    - sex trafficking
    - human trafficking
    - slavery
    - indentured survitude
    - gambling
    - tobacco
    - adversely addictive behaviours
    - nuclear energy
    - warfare
    - warcrimes
    - violence (except when required to protect public safety)
    - burning of forests
    - deforestation
    - hate speech or discrimination based on age, gender, race or etnicity, sexual orientation, religion, nationality

2. lobbies against, or derives a majority of income from actions that discourage or frustrate:
    - peace
    - access to the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child
    - peaceful assembly and association (including worker associations)
    - a safe environment or action to curtail the use of fossil fuels or prevent climate change
    - democratic processes
